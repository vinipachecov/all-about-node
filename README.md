# all-about-node
This repository has my code for a Node.js course I've watched in Udemy. It goes through some of the basics of Node framework
and then we build some apps with express to help fixing the foundations of this technology.


# About
Here the author of the course goes to the major points of node and at the end we build a chat with Node + Express + Socket.Io. 
Every folder here is a different nodejs app.
The focus in this course is mostly for web development.

# Basics

Gives you some of the basic aspects of routing with Node.js withouth express.

# ChatCat

One of the major projects of the course. This is a chat app with node.js and socket.io. The course helps you giving you the view templates, and you only have to develop the "business logic".

# PhotoGrid 
On photogrid app the course helps you to use a different environment, Amazon Web Services and AWS with Node.js. This app is just a photogrid that you can upload and vote (click) on each image. Here the instructor gives us some help with AWS setup with EC2, S3 Bucket and Cloud Front.

# Apollo
Apollo is the final application, where the instructor tries to show us the basics of a messaging broker. He uses Apache Apollo and a Python service besides the Node.JS app that we build.
