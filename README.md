# all-about-node
This repository has my code for a Node.js course I've watched in Udemy. It goes through some of the basics of Node framework
and then we build some apps with express to help fixing the foundations of this technology.


# About
Here the author of the course goes to the major points of node and at the end we build a chat with Node + Express + Socket.Io. 
Every folder here is a different nodejs app.
